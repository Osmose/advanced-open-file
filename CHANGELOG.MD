  itiut!).


0.16.1 (April 18, 2016)
=======================
* #103, #104: Re-add React rewrite and replace react-for-atom with React

0.16.0 (April 18, 2016)
=======================
* #103, #104: Revert 0.15.0 due to conflicts with other packages using
  react-for-atom.


0.15.0 (April 17, 2016)
=======================
* #86: Improve performance when listing large directories by caching file reads
  and only rendering visible DOM nodes in the directory listing. This involved
  a rewrite of the view layer using React.


0.14.3 (March 6, 2016)
======================
* #93: Do not close dialog when adding project folders.


0.14.2 (February 6, 2016)
=========================
* #89: Add error handling when creating files or directories fails.


0.14.1 (December 29, 2015)
==========================

* Fix issue where opening a path immediately after autocompleting it opened the
  pre-autocomplete path instead of the full path.


0.14.0 (December 26, 2015)
==========================

* #82: Add shortcuts for opening files in new split panes.
* #57: Add setting for fuzzy filename matching.
* #84: Cursor no longer resets to the end of the path when typing in the middle

* #80: Fall back to project root as initial path when the active editor doesn't
  have a path, such as the settings pane.
* #79: Fix gap below cursor in the textbox and cut-off shadows on the sides.


0.13.0 (November 29, 2015)
==========================

* Ignore all errors when running stat on files and treat them as if they don't
  exist. Previously only ENOENT errors were ignored.
* Fix bug in path shortcuts where they were being applied even if a path
  separator wasn't before the shortcut itself.
* #63: Implement event handler API as a versioned service for other packages.
* #60: Treat "~/" at the start of a path as the user's home directory if fast
  directory switching is turned off.
* #70: Add setting for enabling directory creation from the open dialog.
* #61: Add keyboard shortcut for adding project directories.
* #72: Determine modal max height programmatically for themes that place modals
  at odd positions.


0.12.3 (November 14, 2015)
==========================

* #69: Fix bug with autocomplete where we calculated the wrong bounds while
  finding the common prefix between two paths.
* #71: Re-add scrolling the file list when moving the cursor to an item that
  isn't currently visible.


0.12.2 (November 9, 2015)
=========================

* #67: Absolutify relative paths before attempting to create them.
* #66: Make autocomplete case-insensitive unless there is a capital letter in
  the path fragment. This makes it consistent with how the file listing behaves.


0.12.1 (November 9, 2015)
=========================

* #68: Removed Babel polyfill because it breaks other packages due to it's
  global polyfilling.


0.12.0 (November 6, 2015)
=========================

* Rewrote package using ES2015 via Atom's built-in Babel support. Replaced use
  of space-pen and jQuery with standard DOM functions for noticeably faster
  performance. Added specs for testing package behavior and added a TravisCI
  config to run them automatically.
* As part of rewrite, changed path separator behavior to detect which slash to
  use based on the existing path, e.g. `/foo/bar` uses `/`, while `\baz\biff`
  uses `\`.
* Removed the `Case-sensitive auto-completion` preference. Now auto-completion
  is always case-sensitive, and matching for the file listing is
  case-insensitive unless the current fragment contains a capital letter, in
  which case it becomes case-sensitive.


0.11.0 (October 5, 2015)
========================

* Add `advanced-open-file:delete-path-component` command for easily navigating
  directory hierarchies. (artagnon)
* Add `advanced-open-file:confirm-selected-or-first` command for easier opening
  of files; selects first item when nothing is selected. (artagnon)


0.10.0 (September 19, 2015)
===========================

* Disabled soft-word-wrap on the path input to avoid scrolling/wrapping issues
  on long paths.
* Improve directory detection for adding the project folder button. Fixes an
  issue with Windows directories starting with a drive letter missing the
  button.
* Rename Helm-style shortcuts to fast directory-switch shortcuts and add a new
  shortcut `:/` for switching to the project root directory.
* Only show the parent directory in the listing if the file list is not being
  filtered.
* Show "Add as project folder" button for all folders that are not project
  folders. Previously all folders within project folders were missing the
  button.
* Scroll cursor in input to the end of the text when triggering autocomplete.


0.9.2 (September 7, 2015)
=========================

* Improved dialog layout. (JesseLeite)
* Added event emitter, `onDidOpenFile`, and `onDidCreateFile` for other packages
  to detect when files are opened.


0.9.1 (September 4 2015)
========================

* Update description and README and publish to update the registry.


0.9.0 (September 4 2015)
========================

* Fix handling of Windows paths by replace all forward-slash instances
  with path.sep, and detecting the root directory for a path better.
* Removed support for creating multiple paths at once, as it doesn't
  really fit with what advanced-open-file is about and made the code
  harder to understand.
* Add `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` and `Ctrl-i`/`Ctrl-k` as alternative keybindings
  for moving through the file list, and use commands for all keybindings
  to make customization easier.
* Fix bug where clearing the input and entering "~/" with Helm-style
  shortcuts enabled did not automatically fill in the user's home
  directory.
* Added option for the default input value on toggle.
* When scrolling with the keyboard, the list of matching files now
  scrolls to show the selected file when it is out of view.
* Paths entered in the input that are not absolute are now considered
  relative to the first project root. When relative paths are being used, the
  directory listing will not show a parent entry past the project root.


0.8.2 (August 3 2015)
=====================

* Make icons in dropdown compatible with the file-icons package. SUCH FANCY
* Add icon to directories entries that, when clicked, adds them as project

  fail instead of selecting the clicked list item.

  switching enabled.

  Directories are added to the current path, while files are immediately
  opened.

  Up and down arrow keys will select list items and Enter will select
  them in the same way a mouse click does.

  directory.

  paths that don't exist.
