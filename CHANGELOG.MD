0.12.0 (November 6, 2015)
=========================

* Rewrote package using ES2015 via Atom's built-in Babel support. Replaced use
  of space-pen and jQuery with standard DOM functions for noticeably faster
  performance. Added specs for testing package behavior and added a TravisCI
  config to run them automatically.
* As part of rewrite, changed path separator behavior to detect which slash to
  use based on the existing path, e.g. `/foo/bar` uses `/`, while `\baz\biff`
  uses `\`.


0.11.0 (October 5, 2015)
========================

* Add `advanced-open-file:delete-path-component` command for easily navigating
  directory hierarchies. (artagnon)
* Add `advanced-open-file:confirm-selected-or-first` command for easier opening
  of files; selects first item when nothing is selected. (artagnon)


0.10.0 (September 19, 2015)
===========================

* Disabled soft-word-wrap on the path input to avoid scrolling/wrapping issues
  on long paths.
* Improve directory detection for adding the project folder button. Fixes an
  issue with Windows directories starting with a drive letter missing the
  button.
* Rename Helm-style shortcuts to fast directory-switch shortcuts and add a new
  shortcut `:/` for switching to the project root directory.
* Only show the parent directory in the listing if the file list is not being
  filtered.
* Show "Add as project folder" button for all folders that are not project
  folders. Previously all folders within project folders were missing the
  button.

========================

* Fix handling of Windows paths by replace all forward-slash instances
  with path.sep, and detecting the root directory for a path better.
* Removed support for creating multiple paths at once, as it doesn't
  really fit with what advanced-open-file is about and made the code
  harder to understand.
* Add `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` and `Ctrl-i`/`Ctrl-k` as alternative keybindings
  for moving through the file list, and use commands for all keybindings
  to make customization easier.
* Fix bug where clearing the input and entering "~/" with Helm-style
  shortcuts enabled did not automatically fill in the user's home
  directory.
* Added option for the default input value on toggle.
* When scrolling with the keyboard, the list of matching files now
  scrolls to show the selected file when it is out of view.
* Paths entered in the input that are not absolute are now considered
  relative to the first project root. When relative paths are being used, the
  directory listing will not show a parent entry past the project root.
